On this website we present our ongoing ambition to quantify net primary production in the surface waters of the Central Baltic Sea. We try to compile the most accurate estimate by following a multi-observatory approach, merging observations from VOS Finnmaid and the hydrographical GETM model (, and later potentially ARGO floats and satellites).

The documentation of the project is realized with `workflowr`, combining `R Markdown` with the version control Github as input for this webside. The following packages are needed.

Please navigate trough the navbar on top to take a look at the various chapters of this project.
The links in the upper right corner bring you to the source code of this project and back to Jens' main homepage.
