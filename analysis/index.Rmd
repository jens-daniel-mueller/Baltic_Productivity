On this website we present our ongoing ambition to quantify net primary production in the surface waters of the Central Baltic Sea. We try to compile the most accurate estimate by following a multi-observatory approach, merging observations from VOS Finnmaid, the hydrographical GETM model, ARGO floats and satellites.

Please navigate trough the navbar on top to take a look at the various chapters of this project.
The links in the upper right corner bring you to the source code of this project and back to Jens' main homepage.
